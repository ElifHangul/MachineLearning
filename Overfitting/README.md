Experimental framework to study various aspects of overfitting.

A dataset is generated. On that dataset; g2 and g10, the best fitted hypotheses to the data from H2 and H10 are obtained then questions about 
how to normalize f, 
how to obtain g2, g10,
how to compute Eout for a given g10,
are answered.

Then the experiment is run with different combinations for  Qf, N and variance for calculation average Eout(H2) and Eout(H10). Overfit measure (Eout (H10)-Eout (H2)) is defined.
An acceptable number of experiments to average over is selected using variance.
